points which are members of a single class. A clustering result satisfies **completeness** if all the data points that are members of a given class are elements of the same cluster. Given the homogeneity score of 0.88 and completeness score of 0.87, we can conclude that 88% of the data points in a cluster are data points which are members of a single class, and 87% of the the data points that are members of a given class are elements of the same cluster. These are very good results. "]}]}
